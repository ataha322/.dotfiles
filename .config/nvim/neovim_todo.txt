1. File tree - either make netrw usable or use oil.nvim or something else.
* Support toggle - open/close netrw on the same shortcut.
* Research file explorers in vim.
* Anything like mc?
* I could just use mc, then need to deactivate netrw (or have it to show a simple file tree)

2. AI agent chat.
* Try to get copilotchat to work conveniently.
** Are prompt prefixes useful?
** Figure out prefix notations.
** markdown rendering.
* Or try codecompanion.
* When will tpope release official support?

3. Make neovim+kitty work on macos.

4. Do I want to swap fn and control keys on macos? +

5. Figure out the problem with alt key on macos.
* Nvim seems to treat `command` like `alt`, but this is conflicting with system shortcuts.

6. Buffer switches `[b` and `]b` don't work in some buffers like terminal or netrw.
I think this is because they're unlisted.

7. Lsp servers arent' attached if file is opened directly - example `nvim main.go`

8. make command key into alt (maybe exclusively for kitty?)
